I'm N. Morgan, and this blog/hub is a record of my transition from education to IT. I used to be a high school English teacher, but now I work as a substitute teacher and am self-teaching my way to a career in Linux systems analysis or administration. I've been curious about computers since watching struggling with DOS games and watching _The X-Files_ as a kid, I built my first websites in 1998 and went to college planning to pursue programming as a career, but I got discouraged in undergrad and took a different direction. Almost twenty years after graduating from high school, I'm now finally doing what I set out to do then.

In here, I'll be writing about what I learn and how I learn it, including the resources I use to do so. A lot of information I've found online so far for starting a career in IT has been frustratingly bipolar. Either the material assumes **zero** computer knowledge or **exhaustive** computer knowledge. I hope that this site can help at least one person like me, who's coming in in the middle.

If you're curious about the rest of my life, click the rose below or [here](http://anankastick.carrd.co) to go to my site hub, which leads to my regular blog, my Goodreads and who knows where else.
