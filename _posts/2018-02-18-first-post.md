After an embarrassing number of hours of work, I've finally managed to get this little blog up and running. I have never really used GitHub before, and I'm a total Linux novice--not even a novice, more like a wannabe--so it was a challenge. Right now, I'm using [Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) to build this site. It's a Jekyll-based blog. It was really difficult to find tutorials that weren't so technical or so fast that I couldn't follow them. A lot of them seemed to assume quite a bit of prior knowledge, so I'm grateful for the few I found. I'll list them at the bottom of the post.

My goal is to become a Linux systems analyst, so during part of the time I spent waiting for downloads and installations for this blog to complete I was preparing my laptop to learn Linux. I have a book on it, but it's very outdated, so I'm going to try out some of the free training materials from the Linux Foundation. I'm not proficient enough to do a full installation (there have been terrible mishaps with dual boots and bad partitions in the past), so I'm using VirtualBox as my sandbox. I'll be tinkering with that tonight while my fiance is at work!

Lastly, I've never been able to get into video games. SNES was the most complex console I ever had fun with. Beyond that, there was just way too much going on. I'm a sucker for rabbit holes, and I found that the myriad options available for customization, skills, items, etc. made it impossible for me to actually _play_ newer games! That being said, I'm really interested in this surging 2D and story gaming movement. An old friend, [Dr. Brooke Wonders](http://girlwonders.wordpress.com), just completed a story game called [Heloise & Wulf](https://paracatgames.itch.io/anxiety), which I've enjoyed and I'm very curious about the process and wondering if I could finally become a gamer this way! Maybe even write one! I'll probably write about other experiences I have with these games at some point.
