I am terrible at the self-discipline part of self-teaching. A big part, I know! So I thought that if I spent money on it, instead of only using free resources, I'd be more able to force myself to sit down and _learn_. Udemy is having a sale, so I ended up registering for a Linux Systems Administration crash course and a prep class for CompTIA's A+ certification exams. I'm not terribly interested in hardware stuff, but it's probably very useful to know and if I pass, it'd probably be good to have on my resume since I'm a very entry level person.

I started one of the courses today, and it's alright so far. It's a challenge for me to learn from videos, since I'm usually a book-and-notes kind of student, but I have Ehlers Danlos syndrome and my by-hand notetaking capabilities have been reduced to almost nothing by this point. Also, I need to get better at listening anyway, so this is a good task. So far the pace is reasonable and the lectures are structured well. I'm planning on doing some book learnin', too, though, and rented two books I've seen recommended a million times by working sysadmins. If I like them, I'll just buy them out when the rental period ends. I hate Amazon's predatory, capitalist policies, but I'm too broke not to appreciate the resulting pricing options.

I've decided to learn using CentOS in a virtual environment, so I can't wait to get my upgrades going so that I can try it out on the MacBook. Snow Leopard is supposed to be here by Tuesday. I'm ordering my RAM right now. (I think I wrote MB in my last post instead of GB...lol...) 

On the MacBook front, I got a little TV for $10 on OfferUp and I'm using it as an external display. It works great, but the MacBook has decided that it wants to go to sleep _permanently_ when I try running it in closed clamshell mode, no matter what I do. I've tweaked the Energy Saver settings, I've changed the order of turning things on, I've reset PRAM--nothing has convinced this little machine that it wants to do work with its eyes closed. So for now I keep it open with the brightness turned all the way down and have it sitting on the floor next to my desk. Maybe it will get over this quirk when I upgrade the OS. Who knows. Anyway, hopefully everything will be up and running on it sometime in the first week of March, depending on how long things take to ship.
