I did my first punk rock hardware repair on Jill the MacBook, hereafter to be referred to simply as Jill. I'd forgotten that the reason my mom gave Jill to me was that she could no longer get Jill to play DVDs. She hadn't explained what was going wrong, though, so I completely forgot about it. Today I was planning on playing a CD while I worked on my online classes. I tried putting one in and...nope. I got it about halfway in and then it just stopped. I freaked out for a second because the only way I know of to proceed with my plan for Jill is to upgrade to Snow Leopard, which I can only do via disc. Shoot!

I started frantically googling for solutions to the problem. I tried reboots, reboots holding certain keys, Konami-code like combinations of keys and keystrokes. Nothing. I tried forcing an eject using terminal to see if I could "wake up" the drive:

The optical drive definitely made noises. It was awake, but nothing came out and nothing went in. It was like trying to get a discerning toddler to eat brussels sprouts. Finally, I came across a far less elegant solution. Since the disc went about halfway in and then stopped, it seemed there was a rotor or something blocking it. I jimmied it down with my Costco card and slid the CD in with it. Bam. Functional optical drive.

So from now on Jill has to stay on a hard, flat surface to keep the drive working correctly. This seems like a really simple, dumb problem, probably, but I was very proud of myself for solving it. I persevered, didn't panic and executed some pretty effective searches. Those are important skills, so I want to make sure I recognize them in myself! I've plenty of time to feel inept and discouraged. For right now, I got a problem solved! And now I have a copy of Dead Can Dance's _Toward the Within_ in my ancient iTunes account. (At least until I upgrade and iTunes is no more!)
