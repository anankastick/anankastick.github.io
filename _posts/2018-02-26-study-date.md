After my optical drive triumph (hehe), I hit the books. I am definitely a learn-by-doing kind of person, so I've put my Linux introduction course on hold until I can at least use a virtual box. (I'm at a point in the lessons where there's a lot of I-do > You-do stuff. I won't remember if unless I practice!) Instead, I read the first 60 pages or so of the _Linux System Administrators Guide_ from the Linux Documentation Project. It's out of date, of course, since the last update was way back in 2005, but it's helping me get a basic understanding of the big picture stuff. I know just enough about how to use Linux to not be completely lost, either, which helps.

I also spent some time reading about Unix, since I hardly knew anything about it (other than that it is referenced in _Jurassic Park_ and that it has something to do with the C language!). I learned about how file system hierarchies evolved and why they are effective. I also read a bit about how Linux grew out of Unix, as well as the relationship between Linux and GNU. I hadn't realized there was so much tension between the FSF camp and the...Linux...camp! Some of the terminology tripped me up, mostly because writers seemed to be using terms interchangeably or using more than one term to refer to something without warning the reader. As an English teacher, this is one of my biggest pet peeves about technical documentation. It's all well and good to tell someone to RTFM, but if the manual is written in inconsistent, opaque jibberish with a lot of assumptions made about the reader that's not very productive advice. I know a lot of documentation and manuals are written by non-writers, but these practices present an unnecessary barrier to new users and to people who already struggle with written information for whatever reason.

I know that part of the reason for this pointless esotericism is elitism and the cliched geek attitude that if you have to ask, you'll never know. That's really unfortunate, especially in movements that seem so focused on freedom of information. It's like saying that free information and, therefore, agency, depends on an ability to mine it. That's just gatekeeping. I think I would like to be involved with a project that worked to dismantle these barriers by creating free, _accessible_ information! 

Snow Leopard should get here tomorrow, so installing it will be the big project for the day. Hopefully, by this time tomorrow I'll have an upgraded OS and a working virtual box to really dive into practicing what I'm learning about Linux.
