So, running Linux live on my Windows laptop turned out to be disastrous. I put it to sleep after poking around with Ubuntu, which I remembered I had a USB stick for, and when I tried waking it up? Nothing. Rebooted into...nothing. No OS. No error message. BIOS check didn't even happen. It was running Windows 10, so I tried doing the multiple reboots thing, hoping it would go into recovery mode, but it never did. It turns on, but it's just a blank, black screen. From what I'm reading and hearing from more tech-savvy friends, my only hope at this point is creating a Windows recovery stick and seeing if it'll boot to that. Right now, I don't have a machine that can do that, so it'll have to wait. The lesson here? Always have recovery/backup ready even if you think your tinkering is low-impact!

Anyway, this situation is pushing me into a laptop resurrection project that I've been daydreaming about for awhile. I have a 2,1 MacBook that I've been wanting to upgrade. It was my mom's. It's still running Leopard and has had no hardware upgrades. The display is really distorted (pink and green instead of blue and gray), so the first step was to see if that was a screen problem or something more significant, like the logic board. To determine that, I had to order a mini-DVI adapter (since who on Earth has a mini-DVI cable?!?) and plug the laptop into my TV (the only external display I have available). It worked beautifully, so the problem is just with the screen or the internal cable for the screen. I tried hitting it (ha) to see if I could bully it back into place, but that didn't change anything. So now I just need a monitor or another TV if I want to do any design-type work with it. (I don't, so that can wait a bit til I find something relatively inexpensive.)

The next issue is upgrading the OS. Since it's running Leopard, I can't download anything at all, since no current browsers are supported. So I have a copy of Snow Leopard coming in the mail. The laptop meets the minimum requirements for that, but to go further I'm going to need to add more RAM. I also want to get an external hard drive because I'm not awesome at this yet, so I'd rather do any further OS changes on an external. (For the same reason, I'll probably just run Linux live at least for awhile.) Anyway, the 2,1 can accept 4MB, but can only _access_ 3MB. Still, it's better, I'm learning, to keep those parallel, so I'll install 4MB.

Without running a startup mode checker, I don't know if I'll be able to upgrade to El Capitan (definitely not Sierra), since it seems unclear which 2006-2009 MacBooks are supported. That'll also tell me more about which distros I can run, since 32-bit versions seem to require a little more digging. (Again, I'm totally new at most of this, so it's probably a lot easier than it looks to me.)

I'm using the Linux Foundation's training courses to learn about Linux, as well, but that's kind of on hold until I can actually use Linux again. I'm very much a learn-by-doing person, so while I'm trying to keep reading and watching videos, it's hard for me to really understand some of what I'm seeing without being able to use it. Hopefully, I'll be back on course very soon. I'm excited about getting this MacBook going, though!
