	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<p>I'm N. Morgan, and this is my baby IT nerd site. Here, I'll be blogging about what I learn and how I learn it as I transition from a 12-year career in education to a new path in systems analysis. If you want to know about the other things I'm interested in, click the rose below to go to my site hub, with links to my personal blog, Goodreads profile and who knows what else.</p>
